Reflection

Through the Task Manager Activity, I was able to enjoy seeing my work in action. Seeing the tasks appear, 
get marked done, or deleted felt cool. Working on this activity taught me patience and attention to detail. 
Even tiny things like how the completed tasks look mattered. Overall, i enjoyed making this activity, and I 
feel satisfied that I can make something useful and fun.
